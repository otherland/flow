One of the ways to understand Alexander’s story is to see it as a developing conflict (and subsequent resolution) between his ideas and interpretation of the direction and use of himself in activity and the actual direction and use of himself in activity which he observed in himself when he moved. Alexander had to reconcile the differences between his beliefs and models about who he was and how he worked in activity and the conflicting conclusions that analysis of his observed movements demanded.	\N	\N	1	cd6b06e5-7a32-475a-9baf-988a3e2633d7	\N	0

If there is some value to Alexander’s principles, then the teacher serves the student by praising and validating those ideas which are in accordance. Some of these ideas, like Alexander’s own first ideas, will be at odds with these principles. The teacher does not serve his student by letting these ideas go, but rather serves him better by challenging those ideas which are not in accordance right away.	\N	\N	1	cd6b06e5-7a32-475a-9baf-988a3e2633d7	\N	0

Many studies show that vegans have lower rates of diseases such as high blood cholesterol, type 2 diabetes, cancers, and heart disease. Furthermore, by not eating hormones and antibiotics that have been pumped into the animals, vegans are much less prone to all the problems that those compounds bring forth.A healthy vegan diet is based around whole grains, fresh vegetables and fruits, and legumes. This diet is low in fat, has no cholesterol, and provides plenty of protein, calcium, fiber, and other nutrients for optimal nutrition. Healthy vegan diets are great for everyone.

If you are eating the correct RDA of total calories each day, then it is virtually impossible to be short of protein. Deficiency of protein is incredibly rare in modern society, and basically only affects people who are starving for whatever reason. It's not a concern for those who are eating a normal amount. The world health organization recommends between 5-10% of your daily calories to come from protein. So many common plant-based foods are in excess of that, many fall within that range, and only a few things like fruit fall slightly beneath.

There are also complete proteins in plants, such as grains and beans, but some of them have smaller amounts of one or two of the 20. Because of this, they aren't popularly recognized as great sources of protein, even though they have tons of vegan protein. Of the 20 amino acids, humans create 11 in their bodies and get the other 9 from foods. Someone with a protein deficiency is not getting enough of one or all of those extra 9 amino acids. An old misconception about being a vegan was that in order to get enough protein, you had to combine the foods that were missing amino acids with a food that had that exact amino acid, the old "red beans and rice is a required meal" argument. That is a fallacy. As long as you eat a wide variety of grains, beans, nuts, and seeds, you will absolutely get enough vegan protein.	\N	\N	1	1af3b4d7-c6a3-449d-8543-028eefcd3c30	\N	0

Even now, plant proteins are sometimes called 'second class' proteins while animal proteins are elevated to the 'first class' department. This belief centered on early research on the poor laboratory rat which showed that giving extra amino acids of weanling rats reared on a plant-protein diet improved their growth. The same was assumed to be true for humans. However, the parameters of the experiments were set in such a way that differences in the quality of plant and animal proteins were exaggerated. Also, rats and humans have different nutritional requirements, since weanling rats grow at a much faster rate, relatively, than human infants and therefore need more protein. A comparison of rat and human milk makes the difference quite clear: protein comprises only 7% of the calorie content of human milk, while rat milk contains 20% protein. If weanling rats were fed only human milk, they would not thrive. These tests over-estimated the value of some animal proteins while under-estimating the value of some vegetable proteins and The World Health Organization has now abandoned this inadequate method of assessing the value of proteins to the human body.	\N	\N	1	1af3b4d7-c6a3-449d-8543-028eefcd3c30	\N	0

Indeed, there are cultures who never had cow's milk, and there isn't a wave of osteoporosis. To take cow's milk requires domestication of animals, and so by definition can only have been achieved relatively recently in human history - prior to that, did we all have osteoporosis? Milk is for infants, it is consumed by mammals during infancy, then there is a weaning process, and in adulthood mammals do not require milk, especially not of another species. If we really needed milk, don't you think we'd keep on drinking it from our mothers? If that sounds weird, then consider that you're just drinking from someone else's mother when you drink cow's milk - and not even of your own species.	\N	\N	1	2d8f7b24-749d-4ad5-8599-4d44abc7607f	\N	0

The dairy industry just wants us to think it's the best calcium. As long as you eat a varied diet, getting enough vegan calcium is easy. Dark leafy green vegetables like kale, mustard and collard greens, broccoli, bok choy and chinese cabbage, and okra contain tons of calcium. Even grains, beans, blackstrap molasses, and other fruits and vegetables supply vegan calcium to our bodies. In less than a cup of collard greens, there is as much calcium as in a cup of cow's milk. A good number of vegan foods are fortified with calcium, especially soy milks and tofus. There is as much calcium in four ounces of tofu as in a cup of cow's milk. Even orange juice companies are now adding calcium to their products.Calcium is necessary for humans as it helps keep the firmness in our bones, helps our blood clot, and energizes our muscle function. Adults should take in about 1000 mg of calcium per day, and that slightly increases past the age of 50. Some studies show that eating animal protein, especially casein in milk, will actually increase calcium losses in the bones. This suggests that although cow's milk has a good amount of calcium, your body is actually absorbing less of it than it does with vegan calcium sources.

Spinach has 15.5mg. of iron per 100 calories; steak has 0.9 mg. per 100 calories. Lentils have 2.9 mg per 100 calories; a pork chop has 0.4 mg per 100 calories. Whole grains, dried fruits, nuts, green leafy vegetables, seeds, and beans are also good plant sources of iron. Moreover, vegan diets tend to be higher in vitamin C, which increases the absorption of non-heme iron. It is easy to obtain all the iron you need on a vegan diet.

It is commonly but inaccurately believed that animal foods are the only source. In fact, active B-12 is thought to be unique among vitamins in being made only by bacteria. The B-12 found in meat, eggs and dairy milk derives from the activity of bacteria living within the animals. Despite the notoriety of this vitamin, dietary B-12 deficiency in adult vegans is rare: some 15 cases have been recorded in the medical press worldwide since the 1980s. Not all cases will be published but it is significant that B-12 deficiency is so uncommon that single case reports are still thought worthy of publication in medical journals.	\N	\N	1	94834b6b-2a23-4303-ae7a-de3f54a9dd9b	\N	0

As such, it becomes a simple question of - are you going to get B12 from the bacteria in isolation, or are you going to exploit and kill billions of animals just to get B12 from the bacteria within their bodies? In addition, a B12 supplement is injected into livestock to keep their levels up due to top soil being too intensively used and lacking in certain nutrients. So the choice becomes even more absurd - either take a B12 supplement, or give an animal a B12 supplement then kill them. Why take the second option?

That has nothing to do with every other non-vegan either. These stories get hyped because the media has whatever agenda they want. In a story where a non-vegan starves their child, it won't say "Meat-eaters starve child!" will it? But if a vegan does it, that gets brought up, even though it's nothing to do with it.

This argument becomes clearly absurd when you apply it to anything else - if you stop smoking, you'll be putting people out of jobs in the cigarette industry, so everyone has to smoke. Or, if you stop drinking alcohol, you'll be putting people out of jobs in the alcohol industry, so you have to drink. It makes no sense at all. Industries exist to meet a demand, and to make money from people. If people don't want those products, then that's not their fault, consumers are not obliged to buy everything on offer and fund every single industry out there. If consumers' money is not being spent on one item, it's being spent on another, which means there will be greater demand elsewhere, so the industries change over time to accommodate what consumers want. It doesn't mean job loss in the first place.	\N	\N	1	0c96f3d2-7d10-4358-af2d-3025feb4fbe3	\N	0

Continuing to breed them serves no purpose, even if everybody was vegan there would be no logical reason to keep breeding these animals, knowing they will suffer health problems due to the manner of their selective breeding. But even if you disagree with that, and if you really think there should be these selectively bred species for whatever reason - that is no reason to also slit their throats. There are endangered species right now like pandas, tigers, rhinos and so on. Slitting their throats is no part of their conservation, and to suggest doing so would be ridiculous.	\N	\N	1	40b1ecdd-2ec9-4bc6-9055-da9410f479a8	\N	0

Regardless of whether animal agriculture is responsible for 14.5% of GHGs or 51%, it is still a primary driver of climate change. But almost even more important, it is the leading cause of deforestation, desertification, ocean dead-zones, species extinction, habitat destruction, water use, water pollution, top soil erosion, etc. The fact that the entire environmental movement is focused on fossil fuels and not animal agriculture is to the detriment of true sustainability.	\N	\N	1	a9dc9be9-efcf-4334-9d8c-3a7563baef01	\N	0

Depending on the crop and the animal, one can get up to 20 times the number of calories per acre growing human foodstuffs than grain for animals. According to the Council for Agricultural Science and Technology (CAST) 1999 Animal Agriculture and Global Food Supply Report, an average of 8 pounds of grain is used to produce a pound of beef in developed countries. It takes about 2 pounds of grain to produce one pound of chicken meat, about 4 pounds of grain to produce 1 pound of pork. This does not take into account the additional fuels and other resources required to keep, transport, and slaughter the animals.	\N	\N	1	b04df83b-9e4b-4f84-bcd3-530b63a64ed4	\N	0

The arguments are sound and incontrovertible: three quarters of the US's nitrous oxide (296 times more polluting than carbon dioxide) comes from meat agriculture; pigs and cattle excrete almost three times as much waste nitrogen than humans globally (in the US it is 130 times more); toxic chemical and animal runoff from factory farms has poisoned 173,000 miles of rivers and streams; land the size of seven football fields (often precious forested areas) is razed every minute to create room for farmed animals; 40 percent of all grain produced worldwide goes to feed livestock, not humans.

To say "I just like the taste" is to say "Killing is justified if I like the flavour of the dead body". If we follow through with this, then somebody would be justified in killing your pets if they liked the taste, which surely nobody would agree with. Or even extend it to humans and say that if someone likes the taste of human flesh, then it's fine to murder people. 	\N	\N	1	726950fe-f757-4b64-b135-d67a074ac89a	\N	0

It does take a bit of willful determination (for many people) to make the transition to vegan. After a lifetime of being given the choice between broccoli and cheeseburgers, guess which one we crave when it's up to us to decide? We evolved to crave fat, sugar, and salt, as those items are generally harder to come by in nature and are calorie-dense for our optimum survival when we do acquire them. It's little wonder that society has been happy to meet our natural cravings with an endless supply and selection any time we get the urge to eat. This is not about satisfying your cravings, however. This is about the humanity we show other creatures. Human flesh is nutritious, and eating it is immoral.	\N	\N	1	b95d9279-8d8c-46d7-88ea-f7aedfa7096b	\N	0

Bread, pasta, rice, cereal, soups, many brands of cookies, chips/crisps, fries, spaghetti, roast vegetables, baked potato, curries, stir fries, many pastries, donuts and so on, can all be vegan without you even realising. To discredit all food that does not contain animal products is ridiculous, come on. But on top of this, with a little research, you can find simple alternatives to anything you want, or just swap out a single ingredient in a recipe and you can continue to eat what you already were pretty much.	\N	\N	1	aa50eeb0-30e7-41af-84d6-530a8a7dbfd2	\N	0

If you take a handful of plain flour out of the bag and eat it, you shouldn't be surprised that it's disgusting.

So if you're reading this, I can pretty much guarantee that I did not talk to *you* about this.

Because it turns out humans really are a special case in the animal kingdom. that's why. So are vultures, goats, elephants and crickets. Each is an individual species with individual needs and capacities for choice. Of course, humans are capable of higher reasoning, but this should only make us more sensitive to the morality of our behavior toward non-human animals. And while we are capable of killing and eating them, it isn't necessary for our survival. We aren't lions, and we know that we cannot justify taking the life of a sentient being for no better reason than our personal dietary preferences.	\N	\N	1	f0a05c3b-d27b-4899-93b2-b1fa9b191ca2	\N	0

If you live in modern society and have access to crops, vegetables, fruit, grains etc, then you have no obligation or need for animal products. Also, lions exhibit all kinds of behaviour that you would seek to avoid, for instance, violent territorial disputes, and male lions will kill the cubs of a female he wishes to mate with because she won't mate while she has cubs around. Lions are not good ethical role models.	\N	\N	1	d6be8f5b-403e-4cbf-8720-2d9908b6232b	\N	0

We have evolved as an omnivorous species to eat all sorts of things to maximize our survival. This is in line with many other generalist traits we evolved (such as our dentition) which helped us maximize reproduction within a dangerous and often changing environment. However, we never had any biological requirement to include meat as part of our diet, and certainly less so in contemporary times with modern knowledge about nutrition. See Note 1 for a large list of comparisons between biological features involved in eating.	\N	\N	1	af7c888c-c09d-42e9-8d77-b5a5a05d31f4	\N	0

It is proven time and time again that we can live on a plant-based diet in great health, so the shape of our teeth puts us under no obligation to kill. But if we look at this argument more closely - firstly there are animals with far bigger canines than us who eat a plant-based diet, like primates and rhinos and so forth. Secondly, our own "canines" are only named that way because of their position and biological classification in our jaw. They have no similarity at all with true canines which actual carnivores have like lions. They are of no use in biting through raw animal hide, especially not that of a living creature.	\N	\N	1	84b81406-7df9-440d-9234-0f5c35b4aa9b	\N	0

But, that's no reason to be harming them, simply because they are not human. Cats and dogs are not human, but it doesn't mean that you have "humanized" them just because you didn't slit their throat.	\N	\N	1	3e2f5724-e0e2-4e47-938d-8a4fb97f7d84	\N	0

Denying them to non-human animals is base speciesism and, therefore, ethically indefensible. Further, it is problematic to assert that intelligence and emotional capacity exist on a linear scale where insects occupy one end and humans occupy the other. For example, bees are experts in the language of dance and communicate all sorts of things with it. Should humans who cannot communicate through interpretive dance be considered less intelligent than bees? Finally, even if an intellectual or emotional benchmark were justification for killing a sentient being, there is no scientific support for the claim that a capacity for intelligence or emotion equals a capacity for suffering. In fact, there is a great deal of scientific support for just the opposite; that because non-human animals do not possess the ability to contextualize their suffering as humans do, that suffering is much greater.	\N	\N	1	6dbed4f3-7657-4dd8-93f4-fe9c7af64cc4	\N	0

We have defined behavior. As exhibited by humans versus other animals. We’ve defined that to be intelligent but would some other species make the same assessment? I think about this often. We have not successfully communicated in any meaningful way with any other species on earth. A few hand gestures, maybe. That’s it. We haven’t exchanged any kind of meaningful thoughts. Even species that are genetically similar to us, such as chimpanzees. So now let’s go to some other planet. Some other life form. And the audacity for us to even suggest that we would be able to communicate it when there is no DNA in common at all. We can’t communicate with other life with common DNA. Go to another planet and say we are intelligent so we can communicate with each other? That’s hubristic to presume that we are the measure of the capacity to communicate. What I’ve noticed over the decades, that I’ve paid attention to this, is the other animals in the animal kingdom, whenever we presume some level of intelligence for them, further research shows that they are smarter than we ever thought. Or cleverer than we ever gave them credit for being. Humans aren’t as good as we should be in our capacity to empathize with feelings and thoughts of others; be they humans or other animals on earth. Maybe part of our formal education should be training in empathy. Imagine how different the world would be if it were reading, writing, arithmetic, empathy. My kids, they are perfectly happy watching animal shows on our large flat-panel television without the need to run to a circus and see shackled animals run around and walk in circuses. I think most children take very kindly to animals, and I’ve always remarked, not really understanding why it so but it clearly works, that most children programming involves talking animals bringing lessons to children rather than people. Something must happen after childhood for those who then feel compelled for those to disrespect the very animals that taught them how to spell. Or how to read. I spent a lot of my early life just trying to get into the head of a dog and try to understand their emotions. And I think that changed me for the better. Because every time I look at an animal, I wonder what are they thinking about. Animals, they behave in funny ways and some of the highest hit Youtube clips are animals behaving in funny ways. Usually in their interactions with their owners. I think that kind of exposure to the animal kingdom is a good thing. And people who separate themselves from that experience, that can’t be good. Because then if you don’t think about it, it’s easy to discount it or to not care. And we’ve already seen how humans behave when you’ve decided you don’t care. It’s ugly.	\N	\N	1	6dbed4f3-7657-4dd8-93f4-fe9c7af64cc4	\N	0

If a blade of grass is of the same importance to you as a dog, then it makes no sense to feed up livestock on millions and millions of plants, and then kill the animal to eat. This would result in far more plant casualties, which you'd surely want to avoid as a dedicated plants-rights activist.

You can plainly understand the difference between a blade of grass and a dog. Comparisons between the two are completely absurd.	\N	\N	1	68acc7e4-e7bf-419a-9ef2-9e5276db38d1	\N	0

A human stranger is not part of your family, unlike your dog. The argument of "you're humanizing animals" cannot be used, because you are the one humanizing animals in this case, comparing them to your family. Just because an animal or human is outside your family is no grounds to slit their throat. Also, think this through. If you have an animal that currently isn't in your family, you're arguing that it's fine to slit their throat. But if you chose to instead adopt them, then immediately it's abhorrent to slit that animal's throat. It's the same animal.

You might argue that we could instead just eat exclusively grass-fed animals who do not require grain, but this is entirely impractical. Firstly, most "grass-fed" animals are not fed 100% grass anyway, and secondly, it's not sustainable at all to try to feed 7 billion people exclusively on grass-fed beef. There isn't the space available for such a thing, and good luck living exclusively off beef and nothing else.	\N	\N	1	09791855-465d-4a6a-a9fb-77a0c5fbf62d	\N	0

Obviously, it would be even less harmful to grow your own crops on your own property and pick them by hand, without spraying, and without using machinery which can run down animals. But most people don't have the space available to do that to feed themselves at all, let alone all year round every year. So out of all practical options available, it is least harmful - and hopefully in future, as people start to have more respect for animals and more accountability for how we treat them, more advances will be made in crop harvesting in ways that minimize casualties.	\N	\N	1	09791855-465d-4a6a-a9fb-77a0c5fbf62d	\N	0

Don't get me wrong, veganism does have a serious infestation of pacifists, but many of us are not pacifists. I do not care about the extermination of pests in areas that humans are using such as homes or businesses. to kill these animals or deal with a whole slew of problems, failed crops which can lead to bankruptcy, a food contamination that could lead to sickness, destruction of the wood and insulation, etc. This is a legitimate reason to kill an animal, and many vegans agree. of course, apply the least harm principle. if there is a way to do it less violently or without harm, do that.	\N	\N	1	09791855-465d-4a6a-a9fb-77a0c5fbf62d	\N	0

The argument ignores the fact that there are other things to eat besides wheat on a plant-based diet. You could indeed not eat any wheat at all if you wanted, there are many people who already do that for whatever reason, health, allergies or indeed ethics. But on top of this, it's pretty ridiculous to suggest that you'd just be eating grass-fed beef and nothing else. Chickens, turkeys, pigs etc are fed on grains, not on grass, so you'd be just eating beef and no other animal products, and you'd not be eating wheat. Nobody does this in reality, so the claim falls flat. You don't need to eat wheat if you really are concerned with the practices. You can eat anything else, it doesn't have to be beef.	\N	\N	1	09791855-465d-4a6a-a9fb-77a0c5fbf62d	\N	0

Then Farmer Brown captures one of these nearly-wild animals in a way that doesn't scare it at all, calmly walks it alone (no scary truck rides) to a location where no other cow will hear, smell, or see the killing and butchering (it cannot be the same place each time, as the smell of blood doesn't soon go away) and cleanly and perfectly kills it with the first shot and butchers it without any other members of the heard knowing. He then sells this tough and stringy 20 year old meat to you. Why do I find this hard to believe? Anything less than it's natural life in it's natural environment would be the human mistreatment of an animal for your pleasure. And unacceptable.	\N	\N	1	9238ad18-d7c4-4a89-b460-c6d636d6171d	\N	0

The horrors, the brutality, the violence. The disregard for the animal’s experience and desires is hidden. The animals needs are taken care of only to ensure that the quality of the product is not diminished. Why don’t we see live footage of the slaughterhouses? Where are the males? Where are the elders?

There is a misconception that animals get to "live out their lives" and then get killed. Animals get killed as soon as their purpose is served, or as soon as they reach a profitable size, which is at a fraction of their potential lifespan. The very definition of grass-fed/organic/free-range animals is actually very loose and can vary wildly. It doesn't mean that the animals have any kind of quality of life necessarily, it just means the farm has to meet some arbitrary requirements to earn that title. That's not to say that every single farmer treats their animals dreadfully while they live - some actually do give their animals a fair standard of life before sending them to have their throats slit. But it's ignorant to think it's the norm in the first place.	\N	\N	1	046aceda-a430-42a7-8b12-789b04667d65	\N	0

No other requirements—such as the stocking density, the amount of time spent outdoors, or the quality and size of the outdoor area—are specified by the USDA. As a result, free-range conditions may amount to 20,000 birds crowded inside a shed with a single exit leading to a muddy strip, saturated with droppings.	\N	\N	1	046aceda-a430-42a7-8b12-789b04667d65	\N	0

There is a cage-free label for eggs; but it is not regulated by the USDA, nor does it guarantee that the hens were provided access to the outdoors. Neither label requires third-party certification. Even for USDA Organic, the most extensively regulated label, minimum levels of outdoor access have not been set and specific rules do not apply to stocking density or flock size. I wonder if a profit-driven industry will decide of it's own accord to do the right thing at the expense of profit?	\N	\N	1	046aceda-a430-42a7-8b12-789b04667d65	\N	0

As such, in the breeding process, the males and females are divided when they hatch, and the males are killed immediately as they serve no purpose. Subsequently, their sisters go on to be kept in captivity until their egg production is no longer profitable to the farmer, at which point they have their throats slit. This is generally at around one or two years old. The average lifespan of a chicken is eight years.	\N	\N	1	06acc940-cab6-43dd-a07f-c02a410ae2e9	\N	0

Like all mammals, cattle produce milk to feed their young once they give birth. It is a misconception that cows just produce milk non-stop, they do so only once impregnated. As such, when a male is born, he will be slaughtered. Either he is culled immediately, or he is sold into the veal industry and then killed after a few weeks of living in confinement, or he is sold into the beef industry and killed as soon as he reaches a profitable size, which will be about one year old. If the calf is female, typically she will be removed from her mother so that the milk can be stolen, and then she is used in the same manner. Once a mother's milk production is less proftable, she has her throat slit. That generally happens after two milking cycles, when she would be around six years old. The average lifespan of a cow is about twenty years.	\N	\N	1	dcff6c5b-97ce-4f94-a460-4f7bea21b839	\N	0

In the dairy industry, the calf is taken away from the mother, and if male, killed. As such, the mother will be producing milk, and in the absence of her child, will "need to be milked". This is no justification for the process of course. If you were to kill a woman's baby boy while she was trying to breast-feed him, you could hardly claim to be doing her a favour by then stealing her milk because it "needed to be done". The whole process doesn't need to be done.	\N	\N	1	fe38520a-d12f-4f29-bccf-3b7124748dec	\N	0

They are killed when they reach a profitable size, which will vary from farm to farm, but like practically all farmed animals, it is done very early into their lives since animals become fully grown at a very early time in their life. The wool is taken and sold, and then the animals are subsequently killed. Buying wool funds this practice. Of course there are many other issues such as breeding animals into captivity for our own uses, and cruel treatment during the removal of the fleece and so forth.	\N	\N	1	c9dec34d-eb04-414e-8387-e97b72d66a2d	\N	0

The silkworms wrap themselves in a single strand of silk, and they live inside the cocoon until they develop into a moth. In the silk industry, the farmers require a single long strand of silk. If the moths are left alone, they chew through the cocoon to escape. So the farmers kill all of them, either by boiling them alive or by stabbing them with needles. Then the cocoons can be unravelled.	\N	\N	1	eaee9e66-d24b-460f-b0d9-3bd7fe26f07d	\N	0

On the most fundamental level, it is their property, taking it is theft. But beyond this there are a number of ethical issues. The standard practices for retrieving honey involve killing bees by incidentally crushing them. Bees are sprayed to subdue them while accessing the hive. When honey is stolen, it is then replaced with a syrup alternative, which is not the same as honey, and is essentially depriving the bee of their natural food. Bee hives are extremely sensitive and opening them up is highly unnatural for the bees, who work to keep a particular atmosphere inside, which gets disrupted. On top of this, selective inbreeding of bees has weakened the species as a whole, and transportation of bees to places and environments they'd not normally travel to means transportation of diseases that would not normally affect the local population of bees, which is hazardous to bees in general. It's a misconception that honey farming is of benefit to the overall bee population.	\N	\N	1	be9d5b70-a103-4cbd-bbc5-3220bf84b359	\N	0

For chickens and pigs, the stunning is generally done with an electric shock, and for other animals a pneumatic bolt pistol projects a metal rod into their forehead. It is claimed that this renders the animal 100% unconscious, but if you actually look into the facts, slaughterhouse workers will admit that there is no way to verify that this is the case for every single animal, and indeed the process doesn't always work, isn't followed routinely, and indeed, the "stun" can wear off while the animal is being killed.	\N	\N	1	adaff8f8-8032-4b26-a5fe-c176dbd818c5	\N	0

After all, the flesh-eating non-hunters rely on their meat being neatly packaged, with no hint of the cruelty involved. Carnists who criticize hunters are hypocrites. With the exception of cage-hunted animals, the animals hunted at least know the joy of living truly free (at least for a while). This is not the case with slaughterhouse animals. Although certainly callous, the hunter witnesses the pain of the animals he kills, not so with the supermarket consumer, who carefully insulates himself from the agony of the animal's struggle to simply live and enjoy life. All of this being said, even the so-called "noble" hunter falls far short of those who embrace compassion and eschew unnecessary cruelty and pain. And for every hunter who claims to use every portion of their kill, there are a thousand more who only eat some of the muscle and occasionally nail the head on their wall.	\N	\N	1	d568d9fe-fb40-4915-911e-9f159b65ef2c	\N	0

Second, and more important, they do not truly supplant the natural predators. Natural predators look for the "easy kill". They target the young, the weak, the distressed and the diseased. Those are easy kills. They do not target the strong, who easily escape them. These strong individuals survive and reproduce. Because only the strong survive to reproduce, the genes of these individuals are passed on to their descendants, strengthening the gene pool. But hunters do not look for the "easy kill". They look for the "trophy kill". They only want the buck with the largest antler spread. This philosophy weakens the gene pool, because the healthiest individuals are "culled". The weaker individuals remain to procreate. Finally, starvation is natures way of balancing the herd with the resources available. It is sad (especially if the cause was instigated by humans), but it's a short-term condition and ends as soon as the balance is reached. Having shown that the argument of the "noble", "nature-loving" hunter to be weak and false, the question is begged: "So what is the real reason you hunt?"	\N	\N	1	d568d9fe-fb40-4915-911e-9f159b65ef2c	\N	0

Anglers often say because fish are cold-blooded, they cannot feel pain, ignoring the fact that arrangements of temperature control in animals have nothing to do with pain perception. They even try the ludicrous claim that other animals do not feel pain as we do because they do not have our larger brain.

Fish may take 20 minutes to die on a warm day, or even longer on a cold one. If it is not acceptable to slaughter a cow by slowly drowning it, why should a fish suffer a similar fate? While "humane slaughter" for other animals killed for their flesh is a marketing myth, there is not even this pretense when fish are killed. They instead struggle and gasp while they slowly suffocate to death."Catch and release" anglers kill the fish inadvertently at a later time. Many fish will suffer and die, sometimes several hours later, once the culprit has left the scene. Studies have found that a third, half, or even more fish can die at a site. Fish caught at tournaments are at the greatest risk of dying, as they are often repeatedly caught in the same day. Damage by hooks, exhaustion, and sometimes excessive pressure when the fish is brought to the surface, all contribute to loss of life. However, the mere trauma of capture, even for short periods, can herald death.	\N	\N	1	1b3883ff-4818-4078-8b9c-dd8019e8c2b9	\N	0

In nature, the calf would drink his mother's milk and then she would no longer have a supply of milk. On factory farms, dairy cows  are artificially inseminated so that they constantly have milk. They also have their calf taken away from them immediately after birth, which are made into either tightly confined veal cows (males to be slaughtered in a month or so) or future dairy cows (females). Additionally, dairy cows are given growth hormones so that they produce much more milk than they would have in nature. Those hormones cause their udders to be engorged with milk, which leads to infection and intense pain for the cow. When her udders are attached to the milking machines, the udders grow external infections, fill with cuts and puss, and hurt her. Once they are no longer able to produce a large amount of milk, they are slaughtered. Needless to say, milking a cow does hurt the cow.	\N	\N	1	89b9eb18-7a71-4704-87e6-2f7115f48684	\N	0

The egg laying hens go through some of the worst abuse of any factory-farmed animal. These hens are roughly packed into cages with numerous other hens (only 6 inches of space each), and those cages are stacked several layers high. As the hens on the top defecate, the crap falls into the cages below. The hens are unable to stretch their wings or legs, and often develop severe bone disorders. When the chickens weaken or die, they are often left in the cages where the other hens trample them. Of the eggs allowed to hatch, the females become laying hens. The males are useless, so they thrown into a trash heap where they suffocate or are crushed, all to be ground up dead or alive. These are not abnormal exceptions; this is the normal, legal, and accepted practice of egg production.	\N	\N	1	89b9eb18-7a71-4704-87e6-2f7115f48684	\N	0

When we see how they pamper their pet dog and would never allow any harm to come to it, yet wolf down a ham that was cut from an animal that is smarter and more sensitive than any dog.

This can be touching a sensitive nerve in the carnist, most likely due to the fact that the carnist wishes to remain ignorant about the awful truth of their meat. As long as they can buy chunks of muscle pre-wrapped far away, and don't have to face the truth or know how much pain was actually involved, they can continue to satisfy their addicted tastebuds. Vegans see this as selfish and immoral behavior. How can we NOT say anything? It's our absolute obligation to speak out on behalf of the animals. To us, this is the same as if we saw a dog being abused by children on the sidewalk. We will not simply walk by as if it's no concern of ours and we expect that other civilized people would intervene against such obvious cruelty as well.	\N	\N	1	6bc7dae1-9004-49f0-a772-5b1b6241e840	\N	0

If you have a country of 10 million people, do you think that in a country of 5 million people that the size of the animal farming industy is the same? Of course it isn't. Likewise, if you have a country of 10 million non-vegans, do you think if that country instead had 5 million vegans and 5 million non-vegans, that the animal farming industry would be the same size? Again, of course not. Shops sell animal products, and then restock appropriately. If something isn't selling as well, they will order less. As such, the warehouses they stock from will then have appropriately sized orders from those shops, and will stock less ingredients to make those products, which means ordering less animal products from slaughterhouses and farms, which means less demand for animals to be bred in the first place. It's just simple maths.	\N	\N	1	fab164ca-7cb3-4f65-b612-0010259cefcf	\N	0

The way for numbers to rise is for individuals to take accountability one by one. If you want for there to be multiple vegans to make a difference, then become one. There are hundreds of millions of vegans in the world, so we are not just one person. In the UK, 12% of people are vegetarian or vegan. If you look at the age range of 16-24, that ratio rises to 20%. It is completely worthwhile to do this and we are having an effect on the industries. Imagine if everyone who is vegetarian/vegan started buying animal products again - that would be a giant increase in demand. As such, we are keeping demand down by continuing to avoid animal products.	\N	\N	1	e26866db-3967-46b2-b994-fd15ee8b824e	\N	0

But that's not what anybody is suggesting. You can't do that practically because those animals are domesticated, and are not natural breeds, they were selectively bred. So it would be releasing billions of animals into eco systems which would cause so many unknown problems. What vegans want is for animals to stop being bred. It isn't a question of - either they get eaten by wild animals, or by us. We don't need to be breeding them at all.	\N	\N	1	d5aecc98-cd76-4ce6-8843-6215dea3d273	\N	0

If the argument is that some animals have been selectively bred for consumption, then again, that is not a justification. The entire process of selectively breeding them was done at the hands of humans, and all subsequent loss of life is at their say so and is entirely unnecessary.	\N	\N	1	ae479a17-70f4-4092-aa68-4b9c5cc44f2a	\N	0

Farm animals feel pain and emotional stress the same as humans, and certainly as much as domesticated pets do. Their suffering is no less intense just because they don't speak English or walk on their hind legs or live in our house with us. Just because we enjoy the taste of some animals doesn't mean that we should be freely allowed to eat them whenever we please. People who believe in "animal rights" believe that all animals have worth, regardless of what need they can serve for humans. It's the belief that every being has the right to life without suffering or pain. Animals were not "put here" for any purpose. They share the planet with us and we have no right to cause them to suffer for our pleasure.	\N	\N	1	76ad48fd-6200-4de8-bc82-b4326503bc8d	\N	0

Obviously helping animals does not justify paying for their murder or rape. Non-vegan vets are some of the most confused individuals I've ever encountered.

You cannot be concerned about one without concern about the other. Much worldwide human suffering is linked to humans not having access to vital resources like food, water, and shelter. The animal industry leeches these resources from humans, especially food and water. By spending so much money and resources on feeding and watering animals for human consumption (mostly in Western countries), we are stealing it from people who need it most. Also, assuming humans are of more importance than animals is speciesism, a prejudice toward one animal over another. A speciesist believes that a human's suffering is more significant than another species' suffering, and disregards the fact that "pain is pain."	\N	\N	1	65dbe8bd-b751-4571-a5c8-878f47d06701	\N	0

That is setting oneself up for failure (would you no longer drive a car for fear of hitting insects?) But being a "pure" vegan is not really the goal for most of us. The goal is to reduce suffering for as many animals as possible. A vegan diet, followed as much as possible, is simply one (important) tool towards that end. If a person wishes to start helping to reduce suffering by having a "Meatless Monday" or by just cutting out pork or beef entirely, that is a wonderful first step! Then, perhaps after a while, another meatless day per week or abstaining from an additional species. This slow method works for many people and it may work for you. I found it easiest to go vegan all at once, but that was after having a good experience with being an egg/dairy eating vegetarian first.

But that difficulty is no reason to continue to be involved with the things which are extremely easy to avoid, and which form the bulk of demand for animal exploitation. Veganism isn't about dogmatically and irrationally saying "I am perfect, I harm nothing". It is about recognising the harm that is being done by our society, and trying to make a change, avoid being part of it - as far as we can. In future, as more and more people go vegan, there will be more and more alternatives developed because research will be put into new technology. Right now we are a minority, so why would giant corporations be saying "Hmm, what can we use in car tyres apart from this small amount of animal ingredients?" But as the world changes, those things will follow, and animal use will continue to decline, so it will be easier to avoid animal use in other areas of life.	\N	\N	1	af543bce-092a-44d2-bf50-fc07b8c6dcb7	\N	0

If you know of any other way to effectively reduce the suffering of animals that is MORE effective than boycotting the product and speaking out against exploitation, by all means lets hear it. Otherwise, your arguments are nothing more than excuses for why you want to continue eating meat. All of which we've heard many times before - and they're always just excuses. Unless you show ANY willingness to be open to the idea of veganism, you're just wasting your time and ours. Turn your eyes away from the pain and suffering and move on.	\N	\N	1	a6de505a-ae5c-4e6f-be14-fb405bb0abc5	\N	0

I recognize it's not possible to totally eliminate suffering, but the important thing to me is that the effort is made. This is an important tenet of my personal philosophy (look up "ahimsa" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahimsa). Each person must decide for themselves how much effort they wish to expend towards this goal. I feel strongly that abstinence from animal exploitation (veganism) is the most reasonable, simple, safe, and effective act each person can undertake. I really don't need to defend it beyond this.	\N	\N	1	a6de505a-ae5c-4e6f-be14-fb405bb0abc5	\N	0

The 35-year follow-up of the Harvard Nurses’ Health Study, just published, now the most definitive long-term study on older women’s health we have. Since the study started thousands of participants died, but that allowed them to study the risk factors for mortality. Because heart disease was the leading cause of death, it comes as no surprise that dietary cholesterol intake was a significant risk factor for dying.	\N	\N	1	c8f9cea3-d081-4351-9b9a-1243525867e7	\N	0

But what’s so neat about this study is that it’s a competing risks analysis, so it allowed them to compare different risks to one another. So consuming the amount of cholesterol found in just a single egg a day appears to cut a woman’s life short as much as smoking five cigarettes a day for 15 years.	\N	\N	1	c8f9cea3-d081-4351-9b9a-1243525867e7	\N	0

Eating just a cup of oatmeal’s worth of fiber a day appears to extend a woman’s life as much as four hours of jogging a week. Though you can do both.	\N	\N	1	c8f9cea3-d081-4351-9b9a-1243525867e7	\N	0

And the intake of fiber, only found in plant foods, was associated with living a longer life.	\N	\N	1	c8f9cea3-d081-4351-9b9a-1243525867e7	\N	0

Yeah, having a below average cholesterol reduces your risk, but, as the editor-in-chief of the American Journal of Cardiology wrote more than a decade ago, it’s time to shift from just decreasing risk to actually preventing and reversing, arresting atherosclerosis.

Their bloodstream becomes awash with bacterial toxins, known as endotoxins that are present in the animal products. So, I mean, no wonder our body goes crazy! These dead meat bacteria toxins aren’t destroyed by stomach acid, aren’t destroyed by pancreatic enzymes, aren’t destroyed by cooking. They tried boiling meat for hours.

Now the animal fat actually does play a profound role in this whole process by ferrying the bacterial toxins present in the meat, through the gut, into our system. So the reason animal products trigger immediate inflammation appears to be because they’re so loaded with bacteria that can trigger inflammation, dead or alive, even if they’re fully cooked.	\N	\N	1	c8f9cea3-d081-4351-9b9a-1243525867e7	\N	0

The blood of those on the standard American diet suppresses cancer growth by about 9%. You put people on a plant-based diet for a year though and their blood just tears it up. The blood circulating through the bodies of vegans has nearly eight times the stopping power when it comes to cancer cell growth.	\N	\N	1	c8f9cea3-d081-4351-9b9a-1243525867e7	\N	0

So the Pritikin researchers tried duplicating the study with women using breast cancer cells instead. Now they didn’t want to wait a whole year to get the results. So they figured they’d try to see what a plant-based diet could do in just two weeks against three different types of human breast cancer. This is the before, cancer growth rates powering away at 100%. And then this is after eating a plant-based diet for just 14 days. Now slowing down cancer growth is great, but getting rid of them, getting rid of cancer cells is even better.	\N	\N	1	c8f9cea3-d081-4351-9b9a-1243525867e7	\N	0

They were out walking 30 to 60 minutes a day. Wait, maybe the only reason their bodies became, you know, so effective at suppressing cancer cell growth was because of the exercise. Maybe diet didn’t have anything to do with it. So they put it do the test. This is measuring cancer cell clearance. And this is what we saw before, the effect of blood taken from those eating a plant-based diet, in this case for 14 years, along with mild exercise — just like walking every day.	\N	\N	1	c8f9cea3-d081-4351-9b9a-1243525867e7	\N	0

Here’s an actual photomicrograph of cancer cells stained so that they release light when they die. As you can see in the controlled group, there were a few cancer cells dying. Even if you are a couch potato eating fried potatoes, your body’s not totally defenseless. But here’s the hard-core strenuous exercise group. Cancer cells dying left and right. But nothing appears to kick cancer butt more than a plant-based diet.	\N	\N	1	c8f9cea3-d081-4351-9b9a-1243525867e7	\N	0

All right…How does a simple dietary change make one’s bloodstream so inhospitable to cancer after just a few days? We didn’t know until last year, when they sought to determine the underlying mechanisms for these anti-cancer effects. And it is a wild story. I have a whole series of videos coming out about it. The story involves little people and big people, and big dogs and little dogs.	\N	\N	1	c8f9cea3-d081-4351-9b9a-1243525867e7	\N	0

We’ve known for 20 years now that those who eat meat, red or white — including poultry and fish — were between 2 to 3 times more likely to become demented compared to vegetarians. And the longer that you’re vegetarian, the lower your risk of developing dementia.	\N	\N	1	c8f9cea3-d081-4351-9b9a-1243525867e7	\N	0

I wish I had time, believe me, but the videos will be up soon. Bottom line: the answer to the Pritikin puzzle is IGF-1. Insulin-like Growth Factor One is the cancer-promoting growth hormone involved in every stage of cancer growth, spread, metastasis, cancer invasion. But you put people on a plant-based diet and their IGF-1 levels, plant-based diet, go down, and if they continue to be on plant-based diet — this is just after a few weeks — if you’re on a plant-based diet long term, levels drop even further, and their IGF-1 binding proteins go up. That’s one of the ways our bodies suppresses cancer growth, protect itself from cancer, protect itself from excessive growth, by releasing this binding protein into the bloodstream to bind up, to tie up IGF-1.	\N	\N	1	c8f9cea3-d081-4351-9b9a-1243525867e7	\N	0

So the liver releases this snatch squad of binding proteins to tie up, to take all this IGF-1 out of circulation, and as you can see it just gets better with time the longer we eat healthy.	\N	\N	1	c8f9cea3-d081-4351-9b9a-1243525867e7	\N	0

Go on a plant-based diet and cancer cell growth rates drop dramatically. And cancer cell death shoots up. Already saw that.

Let’s take that same IGF-1, add it back to the cancer and see what happens. And it erases the diet and exercise effect. It’s as if you never started eating healthy at all. So that’s how we know that lowering animal product consumption leads to lower IGF-1, which leads to lower cancer growth.	\N	\N	1	c8f9cea3-d081-4351-9b9a-1243525867e7	\N	0

Well, let’s look at the IGF-1 levels of meat eaters, compared to vegetarians, compared to vegans. Does a plant-based diet — is it better at lowering the circulating level of IGF-1 compared to a meat-eating diet or lacto-ovo diet? And this is what they found.	\N	\N	1	c8f9cea3-d081-4351-9b9a-1243525867e7	\N	0

And the same relationship was found with IGF-1 binding protein levels; that’s what we want higher. Again we’ve got nothing here. One really had to go to that final step, vegans, to significantly bind up all that excess IGF-1 in their blood streams. This was a study done on women.	\N	\N	1	c8f9cea3-d081-4351-9b9a-1243525867e7	\N	0

So even though vegan men tend to have significantly higher levels of testosterone than both vegetarians or meat eaters — which actually can promote the growth of prostate cancer, but the reason a vegan diet can actually reverse the progression of cancer, which we saw, I’ve shown you in previous years, the Dean Ornish work, may be because of how low their IGF-1 levels are.	\N	\N	1	c8f9cea3-d081-4351-9b9a-1243525867e7	\N	0

The bottom line is that male or female, just eating vegetarian diet did not seem to cut it, didn’t do your body many favors. It looks like to get that significant drop in that cancer-promoting growth hormone levels, one really has to move towards eliminating animal products altogether.	\N	\N	1	c8f9cea3-d081-4351-9b9a-1243525867e7	\N	0

Okay, just 13 leading causes of death to go! All right, let’s run through the list here.	\N	\N	1	c8f9cea3-d081-4351-9b9a-1243525867e7	\N	0

Instead of adding plants to people’s diets to prevent emphysema, wouldn’t it be simpler to just add them to cigarettes? And, voila, the addition of acai berries to cigarettes evidently has a protective effect against emphysema in smoking mice.	\N	\N	1	c8f9cea3-d081-4351-9b9a-1243525867e7	\N	0

Adding fruit extracts to burgers, right? Now this was not without its glitches. The blackberries literally dyed the burgers with this kind of distinct purplish color, though infusing lamb carcasses with kiwifruit juice before rigor mortis set in does evidently lead to greater tenderness in the meat. And it is possible to improve the nutritional profile of frankfurters by adding ground up grape seeds, though there were complaints that the grape seed particles were visible in the final product.	\N	\N	1	c8f9cea3-d081-4351-9b9a-1243525867e7	\N	0

Well, obesity is so rare among those eating plant-based diets, nutrition researchers have been desperate to try to uncover the secret. Yes, they eat fewer calories, but not that many fewer. In the past years I’ve gone through a number of theories to try to explain this. Maybe it’s because people eating plant-strong diets express more of that fat shoveling enzyme in the mitochondria, the power plants of our cells. I’ve talked about that.	\N	\N	1	c8f9cea3-d081-4351-9b9a-1243525867e7	\N	0

Maybe it’s because of avoiding the obesogenic chemicals, these endocrine-disrupting chemicals in the meat supply. It’s an obesity-causing virus in poultry that may be even playing a role.

Well, true, we can’t break down fiber, but the gazillions of good bacteria in our guts can. And what do they make with it? They make propionate, which gets absorbed into our blood stream. So technically we can digest fiber, but just not without a little help from our little friends.	\N	\N	1	c8f9cea3-d081-4351-9b9a-1243525867e7	\N	0

It also appears to have what’s called a hypophagic effect, meaning it helps us eat less, by apparently slowing the emptying of our stomachs, which makes us feel fuller longer. Propionate regulates food intake, or whether it’s because it slows the generation of new fat cells, but it results in this overall anti-obesity effect.	\N	\N	1	c8f9cea3-d081-4351-9b9a-1243525867e7	\N	0

Animal foods also tend to be calorically dense. For example, to walk off the calories found in single pat of butter you’d have to add an extra 700 yards to your evening stroll that day. Or a quarter mile jog to each sardine we put in your mouth, and that’s just the edible part.	\N	\N	1	c8f9cea3-d081-4351-9b9a-1243525867e7	\N	0

Meaning if you have two people eating the same number of calories, the person eating more meat may gain more weight. They even calculated how much more.

And steak was nothing. The strongest relation between annual weight gain was observed for poultry. Let’s say you start out at a normal weight and eat a hamburger every day. Well, this is how much extra weight you’d gain, in addition to the calories that are present.	\N	\N	1	c8f9cea3-d081-4351-9b9a-1243525867e7	\N	0

Your body’s not supposed to be peeing out its protein. The three risk factors for declining kidney function were: animal protein, animal fat, and cholesterol. It’s not protein; it’s not fat. Animal protein, animal fat.	\N	\N	1	c8f9cea3-d081-4351-9b9a-1243525867e7	\N	0

Is there anything kale can’t do? And if you look at my video “Boosting Immunity Through Diet,” which was actually — if you can see this is June 28th — this is just the video-of-the-day that went up on Wednesday, you can see that eating just a few extra fruits and vegetables can significantly improve one’s immune response to pneumococcal pneumonia.	\N	\N	1	c8f9cea3-d081-4351-9b9a-1243525867e7	\N	0

Well, meat-borne bacteria can directly invade one’s bloodstream through the intestinal wall, or in women, can creep up into their bladder. Just this month, June 2012, we have direct DNA fingerprinting proof, finally, that women eating meat are getting urinary tract infections from eating meat contaminated with fecal bacteria, that then crawl up into their bladder. And chickens are the most likely reservoir.	\N	\N	1	c8f9cea3-d081-4351-9b9a-1243525867e7	\N	0

They can be mishandled and when they are, it’s like handling a hand grenade. You pull the pin, somebody’s going to get hurt. See if we get sick, it’s our fault. Now while some may question the wisdom of selling hand grenades in supermarkets, the USDA poultry expert disagrees. “I think the consumer has the most responsibility but just refuses to accept it.” That’s like a car company saying, yeah, we installed faulty brakes, but it’s your fault for not putting your kid in a seat belt.	\N	\N	1	c8f9cea3-d081-4351-9b9a-1243525867e7	\N	0

Now some have raised concerns about these so-called bacteriophages, such as the possibility that these viruses can spread toxin genes between bacteria, which wouldn’t be good, especially given the difficulties in preventing of large numbers of these viruses from being released into the environment from the slaughter houses. Now it could also allow the meat industry to become more complacent about food safety, if they know they can just kind of spray some viruses on at the end, similar to the quick fix argument about irradiation.	\N	\N	1	c8f9cea3-d081-4351-9b9a-1243525867e7	\N	0

Now the meat industry’s concerned that consumer acceptance of these bacteria-eating viruses may present somewhat of a challenge to the food industry, not that they’d ever be labeled, of course.	\N	\N	1	c8f9cea3-d081-4351-9b9a-1243525867e7	\N	0

We’ve known for 35 years — oh, you can’t even see this — 1977, that a vegetable-protein diet can be used to treat liver failure, significantly reducing the toxins that otherwise would build up eating meat with a less-than-functional liver.

Well, we know that every single prospective study ever done on dairy products, milk consumption, and the risk of Parkinson’s disease found increased risk of Parkinson’s. Why? Well, one possibility is that dairy products in the United States are contaminated with neurotoxic chemicals. There’s substantial evidence suggesting that exposure to pesticides may increase Parkinson’s disease risk, and these autopsy studies have found that the levels of these pollutants and pesticides elevated levels in the brains of Parkinson’s disease patients, and some of these toxins are present at low levels in dairy products.	\N	\N	1	c8f9cea3-d081-4351-9b9a-1243525867e7	\N	0

And by the 1970’s, the mortality rate from heart disease of Finnish men was the highest in the world, even put us to shame. So, look, they didn’t want to die, so they got serious.	\N	\N	1	c8f9cea3-d081-4351-9b9a-1243525867e7	\N	0

So the main focus of the strategy was to reduce the high saturated fat intake in the country. So this means here that’s cheese, chicken, cake and pork basically. So a berry project was launched to help dairy farmers switch to berry farming. Whatever it took.	\N	\N	1	c8f9cea3-d081-4351-9b9a-1243525867e7	\N	0

They pitted villages against each other in these friendly cholesterol-lowering competitions to see who could do the best. So how’d they do?	\N	\N	1	c8f9cea3-d081-4351-9b9a-1243525867e7	\N	0

I’ve got this whole series of videos on the conflicts of interests within the U.S. dietary guideline committees. They’re the ones that make the recommendations, and indeed, whether they’re being funded by candy bar corporations, or the sugar association, or a member of McDonald’s Council on Healthy Lifestyles, serving on Coca Cola’s Beverage Institute for Health and Wellness. And notice, we only know about this thanks to a PCRM lawsuit against the USDA. Very impressive.	\N	\N	1	c8f9cea3-d081-4351-9b9a-1243525867e7	\N	0

Because if the committee actually discussed this research, it would be unable to justify its recommendation to eat meat at all, as the research would show that meat increases the risks for chronic diseases, contrary to the purpose of having dietary guidelines in the first place, right? Thus, by simply ignoring the research, the committee is able to come to a conclusion that would otherwise look improper.	\N	\N	1	c8f9cea3-d081-4351-9b9a-1243525867e7	\N	0

Let me end with what is probably the best summary of nutrition policy in the United States that I’ve ever seen: The new dietary guidelines have been released. They tell us to eat healthier. But not as healthy as to noticeably affect any corporate profits.	\N	\N	1	c8f9cea3-d081-4351-9b9a-1243525867e7	\N	0

People opposed to tyranny have called themselves libertarians. People opposed to vivisection called themselves anti-vivisectionists. All of these movements have been marginalized and ridiculed as they developed.  This is part of the usual development of a social movement.  First, it is ignored; next, it is ridiculed; next, it is engaged; and finally, it is accepted.  The vegan progression is presently transitioning from ridicule to engagement (people are starting to seriously engage with and attempt to refute its reasoning, of course without success).  This will pass and eventually the term 'vegan' will fall out of use as did 'abolitionist' because there will be no need to identify the minority (vegans), instead the speciesists/carnists will be in the minority.  But presently I think we need the word "vegan(ism)" to refer in short-hand to the minority view.

Identify yourselves however you wish, but IMO, rather than rebranding with a new recondite term, vegans should focus instead on reiteration of the true definition of "vegan" and even further clarification and dissemination of the term.  Now is not the time to abandon the label; that lets those that aren't legitimately vegan--whether still plant-based and ethical or no--to continue to alter the meaning of the term, and the same will happen to speciesism, in turn.

Is it really better to confine a few hapless Mountain Gorillas in a zoo than to permit the species to become extinct? To most environmentalists the answer is obvious: the species must be preserved at all costs. But this smacks of sacrificing the lower-case gorilla for the upper-case Gorilla. In doing this, aren’t we using animals as mere vehicles for their genes? Aren’t we preserving genetic material at the expense of the animals themselves? If it is true that we are inevitably moving towards a world in which Mountain Gorillas can survive only in zoos, then we must ask whether it is really better for them to live in artificial environments of our design than not to be born at all.” (8)	\N	\N	1	e5676111-43cb-4dd8-bde7-b69a6a5b4ed2	\N	0

If we subscribe to the 'greater good' argument for animals in zoos, why don't we do it for humans? We could round up a small group of people against their will and keep them in a lab - testing revolutionary drugs on them that could treat/cure widespread diseases, but obviously with the likelihood of causing serious harm and distress. Even if it seems like the logical thing to do, I suspect that most people would be unhappy with that. The vast majority of zoos are businesses, in which profit is the most important factor and the animals fundamentally a commodity. 	\N	\N	1	e5676111-43cb-4dd8-bde7-b69a6a5b4ed2	\N	0

To enjoy them raw, rinse and soak the chickpeas overnight, change the water and soak again, repeating daily until little tails start to sprout. Enjoy your activated chickpeas in salads, along with tahini in a raw hummus for a calcium double-whammy, or even by the handful!	\N	\N	1	ce462026-8805-41ec-8b58-3732cba43650	\N	0

Bok choy – another member of the Brassica family of vegetables (other members include the amazing kale, as well as broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts…), bok choy doesn’t disappoint in the calcium department! Another vegetable great in stir fry’s, and also delicious sliced up or shredded raw in a salad with carrots, sesame seed oil and a dash of coconut aminos (a fermented coconut-based replacement for soy sauce – it’s amazing!).	\N	\N	1	ce462026-8805-41ec-8b58-3732cba43650	\N	0

To get the most out of your raw almonds, soak them overnight prior to eating. This helps activate the nutrients and boost their absorption. Try making your own raw almond milk in your blender with a cup of soaked almonds and 4 cups of filtered water, then save the pulp after straining to use as a dip, to throw into smoothies, or to dehydrate into almond flour for baking!	\N	\N	1	ce462026-8805-41ec-8b58-3732cba43650	\N	0

Calcium absorption is also influenced by the calcium content of the meal. As the calcium load increases, absorption efficiency from the saturable pathway decreases (Heaney et al. , 1990 ) although net calcium absorbed increases as the non - saturable component becomes increasingly dominant (Figure 28.2 ). Practically, calcium absorption is more efficient if consumed in divided doses throughout the day.   	\N	\N	1	618343aa-a985-44f6-a2ec-c4eacdcd762c	\N	0

The idea is that protein, especially through the sulfur-containing amino acids, increases the acid in the blood which, in turn, gets shuttled to the urine, increasing the renal acid load. In order to neutralize that acid, calcium is used as a buffer and then urinated out with the acid.	\N	\N	1	17bd86d7-ddd4-430f-8a17-44bad5603054	\N	0

PTH causes calcium to be released from the bones, thus raising the low calcium levels in the blood. Osteoporosis may result from chronically high levels of PTH. The conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to calcitriol is also somewhat regulated by PTH levels (4). Calcitriol increases absorption of calcium and phosphorus (another major component of bones) from the intestines and decreases their excretion in the urine. In so doing, calcium levels in the blood rise and PTH levels drop.	\N	\N	1	10a1cb1d-c0d5-4ea6-bcde-9613dc76815d	\N	0

Although it is important to get enough calcium, do not get more than 1,400 mg of calcium per day.	\N	\N	1	92e6ea1a-c31a-43e3-b577-c4fdec4c9c5c	\N	0

The EPIC-Oxford study recruited 57,000 participants, including over 1,000 vegans and almost 10,000 lacto-ovo vegetarians, from 1993 to 2000. They were asked to fill out a questionnaire to measure what they ate. About 5 years after entering the study, they were sent a follow-up questionnaire asking if they had suffered any bone fractures.	\N	\N	1	1ea9cb63-cbdd-445a-ad6f-c1ec2996941a	\N	0

After adjusting for age, smoking, alcohol consumption, body mass, physical activity, marital status, births, and hormone replacement, the vegans still had a 30% higher fracture rate. Meat-eaters, fish-eaters, and lacto-ovo fracture rates did not differ in any of the analyses performed.	\N	\N	1	1ea9cb63-cbdd-445a-ad6f-c1ec2996941a	\N	0

And among the group of subjects who got at least 525 mg of calcium a day (only 55% of the vegans compared to about 95% of the other diet groups), vegans had the same fracture rates as the other diet groups.

Milk contains 18 of 22 essential nutrients, including calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D of especial importance for the skeleton. Intestinal uptake of these nutrients is enhanced by the enzymatic capacity to digest lactose into D-glucose and D-galactose by mutation in the lactase gene, a variant common in those with northern European ancestry. An intake of dairy foods corresponding to three or four glasses of milk a day has been suggested to save at least 20% of healthcare costs related to osteoporosis.	\N	\N	1	ae7054f6-e1e4-47ea-be7b-65fc50e0932a	\N	0

Experimental evidence in several animal species indicates that chronic exposure to D-galactose is deleterious to health and the addition of D-galactose by injections or in the diet is an established animal model of aging.  Even a low dose of D-galactose induces changes that resemble natural aging in animals, including shortened life span caused by oxidative stress damage, chronic inflammation, neurodegeneration, decreased immune response, and gene transcriptional changes. A subcutaneous dose of 100 mg/kg D-galactose accelerates senescence in mice. This is equivalent to 6-10 g in humans, corresponding to 1-2 glasses of milk. The increase of oxidative stress with aging and chronic low grade inflammation is not only a pathogenetic mechanism of cardiovascular disease and cancer in humans but also a mechanism of age related bone loss and sarcopenia. The high amount of lactose and therefore D-galactose in milk with theoretical influences on processes such as oxidative stress and inflammation makes the recommendations to increase milk intake for prevention of fractures a conceivable contradiction.	\N	\N	1	ae7054f6-e1e4-47ea-be7b-65fc50e0932a	\N	0
fbd8ce39-fb59-4990-b91c-26f79bcce23e	3	2016-08-10 17:06:39.842794+01	Because of the high content of lactose in milk, we hypothesised that high consumption of milk may increase oxidative stress, which in turn affects the risk of mortality and fracture. Meta-analyses of cohort studies for the association between dairy and milk intake in relation to mortality and fractures  have displayed no clear pattern of risk, and evidence from randomised trials are lacking. Separating milk intake from the consumption of other dairy products may be of importance since a less pronounced induction of oxidative stress and inflammation in humans is expected with cheese and fermented dairy products (for example, soured milk and yogurt) because of their lower or non-existent lactose and galactose content, possible probiotic antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects,  and effects on gut microbiota. Indeed, a high intake of fermented milk products has been associated with a decreased risk of cardiovascular diseases,  whereas a high milk intake is related to a tendency of an unfavourable risk profile for the development of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. We therefore assessed the relation between high milk intake with risk of death and fractures in women and men. We also studied biological markers of oxidative stress and inflammation in relation to milk intake in humans.”	\N	\N	1	ae7054f6-e1e4-47ea-be7b-65fc50e0932a	\N	0

Consequently, there may be a link between the lactose and galactose content of milk and risk as suggested in our hypothesis, although causality needs be tested using experimental study designs. Our results may question the validity of recommendations to consume high amounts of milk to prevent fragility fractures.”	\N	\N	1	ae7054f6-e1e4-47ea-be7b-65fc50e0932a	\N	0

Furthermore, the contribution of milk and milk products to calcium intake is important and advantageous nutritionally. The replacement of milk and milk products with calcium-equivalent foods has been shown to be detrimental to the overall nutritional profile, including the intake of other essential nutrients such as protein, magnesium, phosphorus, and vitamins A, D, B2 (riboflavin) and B12.6,7	\N	\N	1	81c2f139-4009-4de6-a1e9-5ad9de44fc6b	\N	0

Milk and milk products have protective effects for bone disorders, IRS, and stroke. Observational studies show protective, neutral, and negative effects with various cancers. The main concerns brought against including milk products in the diet lack strong and mechanistic support. Some previous concerns, including protein-induced calciuria and the presence of 17β-estradiol, have recently been resolved. Vegans have reduced bone mineral density, increased incidence of fracture, and other health risks compared with omnivores or lactovegetarians.

It cannot be denied that eating lower on the food chain enables mankind to reduce his impact on his environment.	\N	\N	1	50850c4a-5d25-4948-9cef-a1f520aa2df8	\N	0

The first is simply one of consistency. If the environmental argument favoring a plant diet (expressed above) precludes the consumption of meat, then it also requires that we consider the relative impacts of our non-meat food choices. How do we criticize meat consumption as unnecessarily destructive to our environment and then never blink an eye as we consume almonds, cashews, kiwis, bananas and the other plant delicacies which we favor? The production and transport of these, too, place an unnecessarily large burden on the environment, and therefore native animal species, yet we ignore this. Why? Can we really claim moral superiority on the grounds of environmental impact when we, too, fail to select the most sustainable foods simply in the interest of pleasing our own taste buds? Or, must we concede that environmental impact is but a minor motivator for our choice? If this is the case, then upon what foundation does the claim of moral superiority lie if environmental consideration is not foremost among them? Is it possible that we subordinate environmental health to our own selfish preferences? If so, then we must recognize and acknowledge our true priorities.	\N	\N	1	50850c4a-5d25-4948-9cef-a1f520aa2df8	\N	0

Certainly, hunting and fishing necessarily result in animal death, but are they somehow worse that the even greater (and necessary) animal death that results from agriculture? If we consider the animal hunted we find that it is immediately replaced by another individual that would otherwise have perished of competitive pressures for food and cover if not for the death of the first. Nature always breeds more animals than habitat can support, and the removal of these ’excess’ animals has no impact on animal populations or on the habitat that sustains them.	\N	\N	1	50850c4a-5d25-4948-9cef-a1f520aa2df8	\N	0

With agriculture, the habitat animals require is destroyed and replaced by exotic plants that serve no species besides man. Farmers go to lengths to ensure that no native ’pests’ ever again regain a foothold. How is this morally superior to the removal of a few individuals by well-regulated hunting?	\N	\N	1	50850c4a-5d25-4948-9cef-a1f520aa2df8	\N	0

Consider the millions of acres of forest, grassland and wetland converted to environmental wastelands; the millions of tons of chemicals dumped into our air, water and soil, and the billions of gallons of fresh water diverted from aquatic ecosystems for agricultural purpose. It should be our goal to reduce, not increase, our reliance on such land-intensive food production strategies. While hunting cannot support the entire human population, it certainly can support many, and every meal taken in a sustainable manner from wild lands alleviates pressure to convert these lands to agriculture for the purpose of providing those meals.	\N	\N	1	50850c4a-5d25-4948-9cef-a1f520aa2df8	\N	0

Is it because we fail to observe the impact of agriculture? Do we deny the elimination of entire plant and animal communities evicted from fields and orchards as we go breezing down the produce aisle? The day will come, long after the last deer season has been closed for lack of game, that we may step outside to gaze upon endless fields of broccoli and beans and wonder where all the wildlife has gone. Will we then blame the hunter? Will we still claim environmental motives for our choice?	\N	\N	1	50850c4a-5d25-4948-9cef-a1f520aa2df8	\N	0

That's not to say that eating food grown locally isn't better -- it often is. Just that the difference between non-local veg and local veg is negligible when compared to the difference between dead animal flesh and veg.	\N	\N	1	f97fd412-16a5-45f9-8f40-ce9ebe17c9f5	\N	0

This documentary brought to light just how ineffectual these organizations have been in addressing the real problems plaguing our environment. These organizations, like any other, have to answer to â€œthe powers that beâ€ (their sponsors) and in this case, those â€œpowersâ€ are big agribusiness who are the worst polluters on the planet! (Seeing as how corporations have a stronghold in the lobbies of congress, it is not surprising to find out that big agribusiness has influence on just about every single environmental protection group!) In a way, these organizations have become the puppets of big agribusiness, misleading people into thinking that they are doing something meaningful to help the environment when they are not. In fact, they are actually compounding the problem because they are helping to protect the interests of big agribusiness!	\N	\N	1	75afc43e-f626-4f58-9b81-33f61d2b40a4	\N	0

These organizations give people a false sense that they are actually doing something effective to help the environment when donating to them. It gives people a sense of â€œWell, I donate money to these organizations so I do enough. In fact, I give them a lot of money so Iâ€™m doing a lot to help the environment. I donâ€™t have to do anything else.â€	\N	\N	1	75afc43e-f626-4f58-9b81-33f61d2b40a4	\N	0

We, the citizens of the earth, cannot expect to eschew our responsibility for the problem because we throw money at these impotent institutions. It demonstrated that the REAL responsibility and POWER lies with each individual. That the choices that each one of us makes in our everyday lives ultimately affect the entire planet. Real change comes from the bottom and floats to the top! The only way to affect big agribusiness is if enough of us dictate what we want them to do via our pocketbook. If we want them to cease polluting our planet, we as consumers have to quell this insatiable and unsustainable appetite for animal products and refuse to buy their crap!	\N	\N	1	75afc43e-f626-4f58-9b81-33f61d2b40a4	\N	0

This can inspire and motivate us. That is all well but would like to warn all of you against the idea that change is somehow inevitable.	\N	\N	1	7ac017a9-0d89-47f3-b30c-17f834e3250d	\N	0

Matt Ball of Vegan Outreach, (by the way I have nothing to do with them as they are not in my country) has correctly argued for the need for calm, honest and toned down vegan advocacy for maximum impact:	\N	\N	1	7ac017a9-0d89-47f3-b30c-17f834e3250d	\N	0

While I have never met such a stereotypical activist but countless, of passive silent vegans and vegetarians. One of you on this forum the VeganWiccanLorrie pointed out that there has been a shift in the last few decades. Veganism is not so militant anymore but rather politically correct or super sensitive to what other people think of it. I think this is in some sense a good thing, but by being too silent, we are also being ignored and not reaching our maximum potential as a movement for animal liberation.	\N	\N	1	7ac017a9-0d89-47f3-b30c-17f834e3250d	\N	0

I know many "silent vegans" and I think we are so because we have been "put in our place" by the dominant ideology of carnism. We are taught that we can influence others with patience by simply being a good example. The meat eaters will notice, how well we are thriving on plant based food. Then they will supposedly follow our example. After all we are on the "right side of history" and the "arc of history" will somehow prevail in the end.	\N	\N	1	7ac017a9-0d89-47f3-b30c-17f834e3250d	\N	0

These are myths that do us no good.

I have been inspired by VeganOutreach, to leaflet booklets to people, mostly young people because they are more open-minded. I am also going to add cds containing videos from slaughterhouses houses to the booklets I hand out with my local group. This is not the only way. For example, we hang up graphic photos in public places. There are many more good forms of activism e.g. asking film clubs to show Earthlings, pay per view (something graphic). But the point that I am trying to make is that saving animals, does not have to cost much money, time or effort. Most importantly it works. You will make at least one vegetarian or vegan in an hour or two. You don't need to be arrested, change any laws, overthrow the government or wait for years hoping for some change. That is why I find leafleting easy, cheap and effective. Anyone can do it. If you are shy and reluctant to approach strangers (most of us are) it helps to bring a friend with you.	\N	\N	1	7ac017a9-0d89-47f3-b30c-17f834e3250d	\N	0

Yet it is good to be aware of them and not pretend that they don’t exist and that we do what we do for the animals (or other humans) only. Because through being aware of these “impure motivations”, we may, whenever necessary, at least partially filter them out and see clearer. Sometimes this is extra necessary, because sometimes these motivations can really prevent us from being the most effective we can be. 	\N	\N	1	aff09d31-04aa-4e5a-9b69-1c89f1678975	\N	0

What matters is whether the person you're talking to is in a position to be receptive to message that you are communicating <i>right now, </i>and the degree to which they're willing to change their mind. What matters is how appropriate your message is to the person in front of you. What matters is the mood of the person you're speaking to. People don't like to be shamed or judged, and they don't like to feel guilty. 	\N	\N	1	822c59e9-013c-4a82-9a66-551cee3c7b9a	\N	0

This is important. It is far from what we as vegans want, but less suffering is better than more suffering. Also, as welfare improves, livestock production becomes increasingly difficult and expensive. As vegans, we can continue to move the goal posts of what is acceptable until animal agriculture is no longer acceptable.	\N	\N	1	45d17db2-bffb-4533-85e6-4be54bd01f18	\N	0

Being seen in terms of other identities, especially erroneous ones, can evoke “categorization threat“. We also do not like it when another group is so similar to ours, because it undermines the very essence of what our group is that makes us different and special. In other words we tend to be most sensitive when the other group actually is similar to our own (…). Groups that are too similar to our own can therefore threaten the unique identity of the group: “distinctiveness threat“. Some have even argued that having a distinctive group identity is even more fundamental than avoiding a negative one.”*	\N	\N	1	03851941-873f-42bd-8414-321a2b132a2c	\N	0

Yearly, billions of male chicks are killed right after birth because they can’t lay eggs. Layer hens are debeaked without anesthesia, with a glowing hot knife. The efficiency of the egg industry is of an almost demonic level. Animals are packed as tightly as possible in order to save space. In hardly any cases do they get to see daylight and artificial lighting is used to manipulate their laying cycles and production. Regarding milk, just like with humans, a cow doesn’t give milk – at least not enough – when she’s not pregnant or has young. Artificially impregnating cows and relying on them giving birth every year is hence a necessity for sufficient milk production. As for the males, the calf will end up as beef. This is equally true in the case of organic products. What happens is that animals are treated like things, with which we can do what we want, because they aren’t people, not for some morally relevant reason. We engineer everything in a way that ensures the animals get as big as possible, as fast as possible, and to give us as much product as possible – whether it is meat, eggs or dairy."	\N	\N	1	b03cb946-e843-4ee7-91e6-4fcbbb920812	\N	0

We tackle the most difficult and important problems— including hunger, war, disease, poverty, violence, cruelty and exploitation— and work to further humanity’s evolution in the direction of compassion and kindness. Conservatives may create more wealth, but we create more of the values, including justice, equality and freedom, that make life worth living. As history has repeatedly shown us, and as we are unfortunately witnessing in the United States today, wealth without the tempering of progressive values and mores leads inevitably to corruption and despair.	\N	\N	1	68c2b844-5c76-4141-9ddf-4f862a7f8547	\N	0

Much of the growth in the consumption of vegetarian and vegan foods has come from the increase in substitute products and grocers carrying them.

Quickly write a list of 10 ways you could talk to people about veganism. It could be anything, even things that sound crazy or impossible. Have fun with it! Now choose one you like the sound of, one that excites you. Make it bigger. Make it more successful, more wonderful. How could you improve it? There are no limits here. Write in the present tense, as though it is happening right now. These are powerful techniques! Go back to your list of 10 ideas. Pick a different one, and this time, we're going to do it. And it'll be easier than you think. First, we're going to break it into small chunks that we know we CAN achieve. For example, if your idea was to write to a politician urging them to change a policy, the first chunk would be 'get a pen and some paper'. Make the first step a super-easy task that you can do in the next 24 hours. Make a note of what the task is (it's more likely to happen if you do - more on this later), then <b>do it</b>! Back to the list of 10 ideas again. Pick another one for this last exercise. We're going to write about it as if it is a year from now, and during that year you made that idea a reality - maybe even several times over. Write about how it feels: what was easy and what was hard?, how did you do it? Who helped? What worries and fears did you have along the way, and what did it feel like to succeed? Are you chomping at the bit yet? The power of imagination is not childsplay. It's actually a very valuable skill that we often deny ourselves for more 'serious' pursuits. Hopefully, you'll see from this exercise that imagination is a tool we can apply to solve any problem and creatively find a path to success. In the brain, the activity that occurs when imagining or dreaming about something is no different to if the event actually happens. Think about this - what other applications can you think of? Write down any that come to mind before reading on. Done writing? Great. For one thing, this mental exercise can make you prepared for anything. If you need a confidence boost, it can help to remember succeeding at, or even just surviving, something similar in the past. Now we know about the power of our imaginings, we can produce such experiences at the drop of a hat. Meaning that a new experience can feel a lot less daunting. There are many accounts from different schools of thought that also point to the suggestion that what we create in our mind, as an intention, is far more likely to come true. Call it self-fulfilling prophecy, the law of attraction, psychic ability, selective attention, or even common sense, there is much to support the idea. The beauty of it is that you don't even need to believe it's going to work to try it. You can just give it a go. When we make clear our intentions and listen out for opportunities, it is surprising how quickly things can happen.	\N	\N	1	30d6901a-c3ee-4bd3-b42d-7a56db37d6e7	\N	0

You feel so much better, you increase the love inside you, the compassion, the happiness. You reduce your chances of getting sicknesses, illnesses and diseases. But most importantly it means you start living in alignment with the person that you are already - someone who's non-violent, someone who likes animals, or even loves animals, you don't want to hurt animals and you definitely don't want to pay people to slit their throat. And if that's not the kind of person you are, then the thing that makes most sense is to be vegan. To live in alignment with your core values of respect, kindness, justice, compassion to others. I think veganism is in everyone's heart already. It's not this extreme thing. What's extreme is the way people are living now, paying for violence, cruelty, which is totally unnecessary and unhealthy. Being vegan is just about being who you are - a good person, a kind person. 	\N	\N	1	7be152f8-a66c-4f04-b2bb-af6b053850f8	\N	0

We've been wrong so many times in the past, and especially about health.

People on diets for their own health will often "slip up" and eat something outside of their diets (non-vegan). It also becomes an inconvenience to you to be vegan in a non-vegan world. If it's only you that's suffering, it's easier to make excuses and exceptions, whereas if you care about the suffering of the animals, you're less likely to.	\N	\N	1	40dd667e-2737-4ede-8bbf-acf216b097e5	\N	0

Let's point to the evidence when  people say “Well can I be healthy?” Yes you can. Here is the evidence that shows you  can get the nutrients you need and you can even reduce your risk for disease. Getting  people to eat healthier is a multi-billion dollar industry. We have all these  supplement companies and Naturopaths that want to sell you  all sorts of goofy mushrooms from South America and essential oils that absorb through your  skin and make all sorts of health claims and I don't want veganism to be in that category.  So let's get veganism out of that world of making crazy health claims.	\N	\N	1	7be152f8-a66c-4f04-b2bb-af6b053850f8	\N	0

They may supply some nutrients that people need and that is  true and this is what the meat industry loves to point to it's an important part of a healthy  diet, blah, blah, blah. What they leave out is that you can easily get these nutrients  from plant foods, but what the evidence points to is something like the WHO is that  these products should be reduced. Let’s say you eliminate processed meat and  red meat, your average person who isn't a vegan or thinking about veganism is going  to say: ok then I will eat more chicken, turkey, eggs, I'll drink dairy.  That’s how they interpret it, my point is to vegans and advocates of veganism  to make sure we are not seeing this only through our vegan lens. That there is an important  distinction because people want to continue doing what they are doing and that is eating  animal products they want to keep eating animal products. How do we get them to not? Well,  I think we point and focus on the ethical argument and then when they ask questions  about health we can say: well, we have all this evidence that says vegans are very healthy  and that veganism can even help reduce chronic diseases because we do have that evidence.	\N	\N	1	7be152f8-a66c-4f04-b2bb-af6b053850f8	\N	0

One of the most important reasons for this is that an indirect approach is what leads to lasting change, whereas direct doesn't. Also, people have so many influences coming at them (other vegans, media, news, etc.) and you aren't the one that will "convert them". They are. All you can do is help them along the journey. We don't try to force change because we can't force lasting change in anyone. Any outcomes of this approach are often doomed because they haven't been inspired from within. Inspirers. That's what we can be as advocates. We inspire others to live according to the good people they are already are. To close the gap between their values and their actions.	\N	\N	1	82f37e86-fd89-43b6-8c2f-52b30fc6aa27	\N	0

I think it's great to ask a lot of questions and learn from the answers rather than trying to combat them, disprove them etc. Thinking about the interview, it's more that the interviewer is keen to learn and discuss a topic, you get the person thinking a lot more when you're not trying to get them to do something or see something. Explore their ideas - they will see that you're interested and really thinking about what they're saying. I think if you can get someone talking for a period of time about what they believe then that is more valuable than telling them what they should be believing, or all the things they didn't know about. If you find out what they believe and then ask them whether they knew something that ties in with that, and they say they do, it's not a point to challenge this directly. Rather the friendly inquisition will lead them to challenge it themselves. They likely don't need someone to point out their inconsistencies in thinking. By asking the right questions and hearing their true thought process and beliefs (which they will be more likely to share if you are not enforcing your ideas and beliefs, or disagreeing), you are leading them to notice their own inconsistencies and gaps in their morals where things don't add up.	\N	\N	1	82f37e86-fd89-43b6-8c2f-52b30fc6aa27	\N	0

In the morning, the seeds will have swelled up in a most surprising way (at least, it is the first time!).

Some prep required, so make a batch for a few days (lasts 3-4 days, refrigerated). In a bowl, combine oats, cinnamon, nutmeg, shredded coconut, apple juice and coconut milk. Leave for 4+ hours, and the texture will be a deliciously creamy, and similar to porridge. Top with stewed fruit and flaked almonds.	\N	\N	1	d7cc2508-11e4-4ae2-8bed-fa6a758e372c	\N	0

Use rice flour or gram (chickpea) flour, a non-dairy milk of your choice, and the water from a tin of chickpeas (preferably unsalted!). This is known as aquafaba (literally 'bean water'), and is a great replacement for egg. Combine all ingredients in equal quantities, let it rest, then cook in a little coconut oil. Delicious with cashew cheese and tomato puree, or maple syrup and lime juice.	\N	\N	1	77caf89c-5296-41de-acf4-8c7fba3bba5e	\N	0

Put some mushrooms and veg in a food processor (carrots/onions/celery/swede...) or roughly chop. Fry gently until the mushrooms are dark and the juices have come out. Put back in the food processor with some nuts (walnut, hazelnut and Brazil all work well) and fresh oregano or rosemary. Dollop onto crackers, or into a roll if you're on the go.	\N	\N	1	a5c45952-482a-4ccb-b64b-5696013d4205	\N	0

So yes, it is fine for farmers to engage in reasonable behaviour to protect their crops. If they didn't, we would all starve. But that doesn't mean that is is acceptable to then round up millions of animals and slaughter them for our own gustatory pleasure. Clearly, there is a huge moral difference between killing and harming the minimum possible number of animals in the most humane way, and killing and harming as many as you want because you like eating them. In the one case, we are doing what is necessary - and doing it thoughtfully, and even with regret. In the other, we are committing an unnecessary atrocity.	\N	\N	1	58ed0b84-c4f7-43f3-84f9-b8119119fd2b	\N	0

For example, if a human being with a deadly, contagious disease was running towards a crowded shopping mall, we would be justified in shooting them dead. But if we accept that, do we then accept then we can round up all the available humans, place them in pens and them cook them for dinner? Necessary, but regrettable actions cannot be converted into a universal moral licence.	\N	\N	1	58ed0b84-c4f7-43f3-84f9-b8119119fd2b	\N	0

It is distasteful, certainly - but is it wrong? To argue so requires an Aristotelian approach to ethics, which considers virtues are dispositions to act which require continuous practice. In this case, it is wrong to eat the road-killed rabbit because it encourages us to do something which is almost always wrong, and to see the rabbit in the wrong way - as a means to an end. It encourages the 'wrong' disposition. Better to avoid it altogether in that case.	\N	\N	1	58ed0b84-c4f7-43f3-84f9-b8119119fd2b	\N	0

These rising temperatures takers toward what are known perhaps infamously as tipping points, beyond which things will rapidly and  chaotically speed up without hope of reversal. The melting of the Greenland ice sheets and the rising of our oceans will lead to extinction of flora and fauna, mass migrations from countries subsumed by water or ground to arid, and the collapse of ecosystems. If we do not rapidly reduce fossil fuel emissions to around 90% of current levels, and speed up practices to mitigate and adapt the damage is already irreversible, and the global community will experience orderly or disorderly decline into radically altered social relations.

We would consider it objectionable to, say, rescue a dog used in a dog fighting ring and argue that, since he is already trained and bred to fight, that in exchange for adopting him and providing him refuge, we allow him to fight other dogs and place bets on him. Or perhaps we let him be a guard dog somewhere that could potentially put him in harm’s way. He might as well “earn his keep” since he’s going to be a fighter anyway. But of course we would never use this logic with a rescued dog. Even if we are not the direct cause of the chicken’s suffering, by eating her eggs, we are benefiting from what harms her, that is, her “rigged” reproduction, which would not even be possible without the industrial scale genetic manipulation and breeding practices we already claim to oppose, on the grounds that they are horrifically cruel. - See more at: http://freefromharm.org/farm-animal-welfare/backyard-chickens-expanding-understanding-harm/#.dpuf	\N	\N	1	5cad64bc-ab28-4ce6-b3e6-e5a8aafd355b	\N	0

There are at least two problems with this position. First, it ignores the fact these eggs exist only because of the systematic manipulation and re-engineering of the chicken hen’s reproductive system which forces her to produce an unnatural and unhealthy amount of eggs. Secondly, it is impossible for chickens to give their consent to such an arrangement. It assumes that they desire to make a sacrifice for us, but in reality, their intensive egg-laying — and the adverse consequences that come with it — is simply forced upon them by no choice of their own. But, what if we adopt or rescue backyard chickens? Well, as author Charles Horn points out, “If the desire is there to eat the eggs, did that consciously or subconsciously go into the decision to adopt in the first place? If so, the intention was never just one of providing refuge; it was also one of exploitation.	\N	\N	1	5cad64bc-ab28-4ce6-b3e6-e5a8aafd355b	\N	0

The fact is that natural egg laying for chickens is no different than it is for many other birds. What’s changed is that modern breeding has forced chickens to produce an obscene amount of infertile eggs. Beyond egg laying, chickens lead rich and complex social lives, have many interests and are keenly self-aware. They have long-term memory and clearly demonstrate that they anticipate future events. They form deep bonds with other flock mates and other species, like dogs and humans. And yet even if they didn’t possess all of these advanced cognitive abilities, they are sentient beings who feel pain and pleasure much like we do. And sentience, not intelligence, is the basis for how we should treat others.	\N	\N	1	5cad64bc-ab28-4ce6-b3e6-e5a8aafd355b	\N	0

There is no using someone in a reasonably efficient way by treating her as a commodity without allowing her to be killed when it benefits someone else. And allowing someone to be killed when killing her benefits someone else means subjecting her to ALL kinds of cruel treatment which benefits those treating her, or having her treated, that way. That's why, to quote Francione from Twitter, ''[y]ou cannot stop animal cruelty without stopping animal use. Animal cruelty is a necessary part of all animal use.''	\N	\N	1	58ed0b84-c4f7-43f3-84f9-b8119119fd2b	\N	0

That being said, there are untold millions upon millions of cats, dogs, rabbits and other nonhuman animals killed in shelters every year in places like the United States alone, for instance. They've already been bred into existence and then abandoned. We have a serious responsibility to these so-called "unwanted" nonhumans to take them in and provide them with care since they can't, in fact, fend for themselves.	\N	\N	1	58ed0b84-c4f7-43f3-84f9-b8119119fd2b	\N	0

Rather, we need people to consider the issues in depth and want to change. If we are to reach people’s hearts and minds, and help them utilize the power of their choices, we must make people aware that we are sincere individuals who have made informed decisions. We must show everyone that we have decided to use our choices to make a positive statement about how the world should – and can – be. Only then will others be inclined to join us in creating a new world.	\N	\N	1	a18fd6d2-37e9-4f31-9bad-62e20c1ff8ec	\N	0

Veganism is not the bottom line – the animals are.	\N	\N	1	5b80e3b7-5d34-464f-b0d3-ab5b8c372a8a	\N	0

The world will not exists as we know it culturally or socially, and certainly not environmentally. Maybe you think it is up to governments and scientists and big industry to solve these problems, and they are, but that again makes you powerless. Politicians (mostly) want power, and they are given that power by the people. If enough people want something, politicians must adapt to this. It is this wanting then, this changing of our ideas and behaviour and relating, that can bring about system change. You do live in a democratic system. You can write to your local MP. You can campaign. You can do grassroots advocacy. We have reached the infamous tipping points of climate change. You and me, we’re at a very unique point in the history of our planet. We can do something about this. It doesn’t mean we can solve it. That’s not the point. I want to look back on my life at the things I tried, the efforts I made, what I believed in and lived by and strived for. I want to tell my children and grandchildren what I was proud of, and I want you to be a part of that story.	\N	\N	1	ef75c831-2188-4804-bfdd-58f48b87afb6	56676758	56676758

The world will not exists as we know it culturally or socially, and certainly not environmentally. Maybe you think it is up to governments and scientists and big industry to solve these problems, and they are, but that again makes you powerless. Politicians (mostly) want power, and they are given that power by the people. If enough people want something, politicians must adapt to this. It is this wanting then, this changing of our ideas and behaviour and relating, that can bring about system change. You do live in a democratic system. You can write to your local MP. You can campaign. You can do grassroots advocacy. We have reached the infamous tipping points of climate change. You and me, we’re at a very unique point in the history of our planet. We can do something about this. It doesn’t mean we can solve it. That’s not the point. I want to look back on my life at the things I tried, the efforts I made, what I believed in and lived by and strived for. I want to tell my children and grandchildren what I was proud of, and I want you to be a part of that story.	\N	\N	1	5e6f09f7-f003-400d-8749-f28463585329	\N	0
