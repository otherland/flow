The same was assumed to be true for humans. However, the parameters of the experiments were set in such a way that differences in the quality of plant and animal proteins were exaggerated. Also, rats and humans have different nutritional requirements, since weanling rats grow at a much faster rate, relatively, than human infants and therefore need more protein. A comparison of rat and human milk makes the difference quite clear: protein comprises only 7% of the calorie content of human milk, while rat milk contains 20% protein.

absolutely no reason to assume plants are sentient. it's reasonable to assume that animals are sentient because they possess brains, and we know from experimentation that stimulating or moving sections of, or otherwise perturbing the brain, creates various effects in consciousness. when there is no activity in the brain, we see no activity in the organism. when we stimulate the RAGE circuit, the organism attacks whoever is in the vicinity. if we remove sections of the brain, we can cause people to lose the ability to remember certain things such as how to speak and move. clearly brains have everything to do with consciousness, and if a creature lacks a brain, or some primitive form of a brain, there's no reason to assume it's sentient. the plant sentience argument generally relies on a conflation of intelligence with sentience. as if this weren't already obvious we're told that various experiments have surfaced showing that plants have intelligence. intelligence being the capacity for information processing. the fact that plants can process information, such as the location of the sun, and react intelligently by tracking it as it moves through the sky, is not a demonstration of sentience. computers can do this, and at present, they are not sentient. a calculator is intelligent, but not sentient. there is a huge gulf between information processing and first person subjective experience. in the absence of any good reason to presume plants have the latter, calling them sentient and morally equating with humans and animals is retarded. to make this concrete

That\u2019s an assumption. We have defined circumstances. We have defined behavior. As exhibited by humans versus other animals. We\u2019ve defined that to be intelligent but would some other species make the same assessment? I think about this often. We have not successfully communicated in any meaningful way with any other species on earth. A few hand gestures, maybe. That\u2019s it. We haven\u2019t exchanged any kind of meaningful thoughts. Even species that are genetically similar to us, such as chimpanzees. So now let\u2019s go to some other planet. Some other life form. And the audacity for us to even suggest that we would be able to communicate it when there is no DNA in common at all. We can\u2019t communicate with other life with common DNA. Go to another planet and say we are intelligent so we can communicate with each other? That\u2019s hubristic to presume that we are the measure of the capacity to communicate. What I\u2019ve noticed over the decades, that I\u2019ve paid attention to this, is the other animals in the animal kingdom, whenever we presume some level of intelligence for them, further research shows that they are smarter than we ever thought. Or cleverer than we ever gave them credit for being. Humans aren\u2019t as good as we should be in our capacity to empathize with feelings and thoughts of others; be they humans or other animals on earth. Maybe part of our formal education should be training in empathy. Imagine how different the world would be if it were reading, writing, arithmetic, empathy. My kids, they are perfectly happy watching animal shows on our large flat-panel television without the need to run to a circus and see shackled animals run around and walk in circuses. I think most children take very kindly to animals, and I\u2019ve always remarked, not really understanding why it so but it clearly works, that most children programming involves talking animals bringing lessons to children rather than people. Something must happen after childhood for those who then feel compelled for those to disrespect the very animals that taught them how to spell. Or how to read. I spent a lot of my early life just trying to get into the head of a dog and try to understand their emotions. And I think that changed me for the better. Because every time I look at an animal, I wonder what are they thinking about. Animals, they behave in funny ways and some of the highest hit Youtube clips are animals behaving in funny ways.

They also have their calf taken away from them immediately after birth, which are made into either tightly confined veal cows (males to be slaughtered in a month or so) or future dairy cows (females). Additionally, dairy cows are given growth hormones so that they produce much more milk than they would have in nature. Those hormones cause their udders to be engorged with milk, which leads to infection and intense pain for the cow. When her udders are attached to the milking machines, the udders grow external infections, fill with cuts and puss, and hurt her.

Unblocking. Exercises from the artist's way. Quickly write a list of 10 ways you could talk to people about veganism. It could be anything, even things that sound crazy or impossible. Have fun with it! Now choose one you like the sound of, one that excites you. Make it bigger. Make it more successful, more wonderful. How could you improve it? There are no limits here. Write in the present tense, as though it is happening right now. These are powerful techniques! Go back to your list of 10 ideas. Pick a different one, and this time, we're going to do it. And it'll be easier than you think. First, we're going to break it into small chunks that we know we CAN achieve. For example, if your idea was to write to a politician urging them to change a policy, the first chunk would be 'get a pen and some paper'. Make the first step a super-easy task that you can do in the next 24 hours. Make a note of what the task is (it's more likely to happen if you do - more on this later), then <b>do it</b>! Back to the list of 10 ideas again. Pick another one for this last exercise. We're going to write about it as if it is a year from now, and during that year you made that idea a reality - maybe even several times over. Write about how it feels: what was easy and what was hard?, how did you do it? Who helped? What worries and fears did you have along the way, and what did it feel like to succeed? Are you chomping at the bit yet? The power of imagination is not childsplay. It's actually a very valuable skill that we often deny ourselves for more 'serious' pursuits. Hopefully, you'll see from this exercise that imagination is a tool we can apply to solve any problem and creatively find a path to success. In the brain, the activity that occurs when imagining or dreaming about something is no different to if the event actually happens. Think about this - what other applications can you think of? Write down any that come to mind before reading on. Done writing? Great. For one thing, this mental exercise can make you prepared for anything. If you need a confidence boost, it can help to remember succeeding at, or even just surviving, something similar in the past. Now we know about the power of our imaginings, we can produce such experiences at the drop of a hat. Meaning that a new experience can feel a lot less daunting. There are many accounts from different schools of thought that also point to the suggestion that what we create in our mind, as an intention, is far more likely to come true. Call it self-fulfilling prophecy, the law of attraction, psychic ability, selective attention, or even common sense, there is much to support the idea. The beauty of it is that you don't even need to believe it's going to work to try it. You can just give it a go.

For example, we hang up graphic photos in public places. There are many more good forms of activism e.g. asking film clubs to show Earthlings, pay per view (something graphic). But the point that I am trying to make is that saving animals, does not have to cost much money, time or effort. Most importantly it works. You will make at least one vegetarian or vegan in an hour or two. You don't need to be arrested, change any laws, overthrow the government or wait for years hoping for some change.

Even a low dose of D-galactose induces changes that resemble natural aging in animals, including shortened life span caused by oxidative stress damage, chronic inflammation, neurodegeneration, decreased immune response, and gene transcriptional changes. A subcutaneous dose of 100 mg/kg D-galactose accelerates senescence in mice. This is equivalent to 6-10 g in humans, corresponding to 1-2 glasses of milk. The increase of oxidative stress with aging and chronic low grade inflammation is not only a pathogenetic mechanism of cardiovascular disease and cancer in humans but also a mechanism of age related bone loss and sarcopenia.

do you just say that you care? do you just want to appear as a good person? do you just want to feel like a good person without changing your behaviour? why is it hard for you to change? what are you holding onto? what are you afraid will happen? why did you say such stupid things about it\u2019s the fish or you. that upset me and it felt like you thought it was all a joke. why do you joke about things that are so tragic? obviously a sense of humour is important, but don\u2019t you think there is a line? how would you feel if i joked or ridiculed the things that you cared deeply about? do i already do that? if i do, please tell me. what about our planet? i thought you cared about climate. i didn\u2019t care about it before i learned about it from nicola and you. maybe it was just nicola that cared about it? you can do something about it. maybe you feel powerless. maybe you\u2019ve learned all the ways that you are powerless to make change and so you feel the only option is to shrink your circle of concern to yourself and the betterment of yourself. maybe that\u2019s all you care about now? don\u2019t you want to make the world a better place? you can. when you help people out, they appreciate it. when you donate money, it does good things. when you sing to people or are kind to them, it makes them happy. when you take a stand on an issue, you challenge people\u2019s ideas about themselves, the world, and how they relate to it. this is what\u2019s needed for change. small groups of people have changed the world many times before because they believed they could and found a way. why are you the exception? why are you disempowered? why don\u2019t you fight for what you believe in? have you tried before and failed? could you not see a way through? do you still care about the same problems? maybe you don\u2019t care about the same solutions, but there are very real needs still. why did you go to the climate march? why do you play with the cat when you come to pickup lucy? why do you treat animals kindly? what do you think about me? do you think I\u2019m foolish? do you think i\u2019m naive, or that i care about things that don\u2019t matter or won\u2019t make a difference? do you see that they already have made a difference? do you see that people do and are and will have an impact on corporations, governments, and industrial and political systems? i think that maybe you know all of this. you seem to agree with a lot of what i\u2019ve said. you told becky that you don\u2019t want to rush your personal dietary change. i understand this. it makes a kind of sense if you don\u2019t want to fail. but what are you waiting for? what support do you need? why don\u2019t you ask for it? what questions do you have and why don\u2019t you ask them to people who are already travelling this road? aren\u2019t you afraid that you\u2019ll never do anything about it? aren\u2019t you afraid that one day you\u2019ll look back and see that you didn\u2019t even try? maybe you still think you\u2019re just one guy. what kind of person are you? you know some of the facts, you know the problems, you can see that there are solutions. maybe you\u2019re not convinced by the solutions. maybe you don\u2019t have the motivation or skill to find explanations or reasons. maybe you don\u2019t want to find what you fear might be true. that you can make a difference. what about the future of our family? this is a real thing. i want to have children of my own. they will be your grandchildren. when they are your age, the world will be a very different place. maybe you don\u2019t feel any responsibility over that. you make yourself powerless. maybe you don\u2019t believe me because all you\u2019ve ever felt and known is powerlessness. rising temperatures, melting of Greenland ice sheets, rising of the oceans, will lead to extinction of flora and fauna, mass migrations from countries subsumed by water or too arid, and the collapse of ecosystems. The world will not exists as we know it culturally or socially, and certainly not environmentally. Maybe you think it is up to governments and scientists and big industry to solve these problems, and they are, but that again makes you powerless. Politicians (mostly) want power, and they are given that power by the people. If enough people want something, politicians must adapt to this. It is this wanting then, this changing of our ideas and behaviour and relating, that can bring about system change. You do live in a democratic system. You can write to your local MP. You can campaign. You can do grassroots advocacy. We have reached the infamous tipping points of climate change. You and me, we\u2019re at a very unique point in the history of our planet. We can do something about this. It doesn\u2019t mean we can solve it. That\u2019s not the point. I want to look back on my life at the things I tried, the efforts I made, what I believed in and lived by and strived for. I want to tell my children and grandchildren what I was proud of, and I want you to be a part of that story.", "description": null, "complete": null, "deleted": null}}, {"model": "data.project", "pk":

What\u2019s changed is that modern breeding has forced chickens to produce an obscene amount of infertile eggs. Beyond egg laying, chickens lead rich and complex social lives, have many interests and are keenly self-aware. They have long-term memory and clearly demonstrate that they anticipate future events.

The first is simply one of consistency. If the environmental argument favoring a plant diet (expressed above) precludes the consumption of meat, then it also requires that we consider the relative impacts of our non-meat food choices. How do we criticize meat consumption as unnecessarily destructive to our environment and then never blink an eye as we consume almonds, cashews, kiwis, bananas and the other plant delicacies which we favor? The production and transport of these, too, place an unnecessarily large burden on the environment, and therefore native animal species, yet we ignore this. Why? Can we really claim moral superiority on the grounds of environmental impact when we, too, fail to select the most sustainable foods simply in the interest of pleasing our own taste buds? Or, must we concede that environmental impact is but a minor motivator for our choice?

The dairy industry just wants us to think it's the best calcium. As long as you eat a varied diet, getting enough vegan calcium is easy.

Even grains, beans, blackstrap molasses, and other fruits and vegetables supply vegan calcium to our bodies. In less than a cup of collard greens, there is as much calcium as in a cup of cow's milk. A good number of vegan foods are fortified with calcium, especially soy milks and tofus. There is as much calcium in four ounces of tofu as in a cup of cow's milk. Even orange juice companies are now adding calcium to their products.Calcium is necessary for humans as it helps keep the firmness in our bones, helps our blood clot, and energizes our muscle function. Adults should take in about 1000 mg of calcium per day, and that slightly increases past the age of 50. Some studies show that eating animal protein, especially casein in milk, will actually increase calcium losses in the bones.

Meta-analyses of cohort studies for the association between dairy and milk intake in relation to mortality and fractures  have displayed no clear pattern of risk, and evidence from randomised trials are lacking. Separating milk intake from the consumption of other dairy products may be of importance since a less pronounced induction of oxidative stress and inflammation in humans is expected with cheese and fermented dairy products (for example, soured milk and yogurt) because of their lower or non-existent lactose and galactose content, possible probiotic antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects,  and effects on gut microbiota. Indeed, a high intake of fermented milk products has been associated with a decreased risk of cardiovascular diseases,  whereas a high milk intake is related to a tendency of an unfavourable risk profile for the development of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. We therefore assessed the relation between high milk intake with risk of death and fractures in women and men.
